# Project-work
Final code.py contains the program. Launch it to start playing
Make sure to put the ‘drum sounds’ and ‘Screen’ folder at the root folder (or change the path in program)
Instructions to play are available in the program


This is a final year project made by Jithin, Lino, Prapanch, Kalidas
Beatsync is a fun project that allows a user to play drum with just a laptop and webcam.

Enjoy
